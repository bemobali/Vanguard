What I want Vanguard to be able to do:
-Proper running. Shooting capability will be disabled.
-Brisk walk while shooting
-Inventory system
-Multi-weapon capable : shotgun, AR16, Desert Eagle, Ka-Bar, and Katana.
-Melee weapon capable: Katana and Ka-Bar. Semper Fi!
-Grenade lobbing capable
-Zoom aim capable, limited to slow walk
-Supporting animations for running, brisk walk, slow walk, reloading, crouching, and grenade lobbing. I don't think lying prone seems practical for the armor suit. Then again, Gundam does that all the time.
-Video feed from HQ
-Sound bites
-Damage pointers
-Compass in the HUD
-Movement slowdown while in critical damage
-Post processing lens effect while in critical damage
-Heart beat sound while in critical damage
-HUD EKG that picks up speed as health decreases. For dramatic effect only
-Night scope
-Radar blips for ammo and health resupply
-Soft turf sound effect for the footsteps.
-Flashlight attachment to firearms.
