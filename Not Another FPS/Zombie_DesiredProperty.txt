Zombie capability I want to see
-Exploding heads
-Back jerk after the fatal shot
-Eating dead victims
-Smooth animation transitions from walking, running, attacking, back to running, back to walking, eating, and dying.
-Mirroring left-right punches at random
-Random health points from 1-5 for the peon zombies

For the Zombie Boss
-Health bar on top of the head
-Energy wave? I dunno, but with the boss not capable of running, I can run circles around him and keep shooting.
