Game oddities that needs to be addressed:
-A zombie cannot get close to the player because the Vanguard unit has a collider on his pivot point to sweep away resupply
-I can snipe a zombie using a 12GA!
-Zombies can actually jump over each other when crowded.
-A player can be flung to the sky if enough zombies collides with it. One of the solution is to not use a rigidbody on the player. Use a set of RayCast to bring the player as close as possible to the terrain. And calculate the jump trajectory ourselves.
-Player run is awkward.
