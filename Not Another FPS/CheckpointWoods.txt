The zombies need to exhibit a herd mentality. To simulate that, I need to:
1. Spawn them much closer to checkpoint woods
2. Increase their walk sensor range so they can walk to the player ASAP
3. Set zombies to idle if it cannot get coordinate to walk to

For special effects:
1. Add an artifact that the zombies are "guarding"
2. Decrease the volume of the zombie crowd as zombies dies.

Oh and pls fix the sensors. Use an empty gameobject with colliders. No mesh. Keep the scaling at 1,1,1 and scale the colliders instead.
